Create an Issue
-----
Issues allow the Development Team to keep track of what is fixed, what needs fixing, and who is fixing it. Follow the instructions carefully so you can provide us the most information possible in your issue report. The more you tell us, the quicker we can work on the issue.

**Before you create an issue,** search and make sure someone hasn't reported it already! Duplicates will be linked to the original issue and closed.

1. Click on the Issues tab above and select New Issue (or [click here](https://github.com/MCMagic-Archive/IssueTracker/issues/new))
2. Give your issue a quick, descriptive title. (ex: Resource Pack not downloading, Creator Tag not showing, error starting CTF)
3. Describe the issue the best you can in the Write area. Don't hold back, write as much as you can. You can also format using the format options above the text box.
4. Submit the issue by clicking Submit new issue.
5. Developers will be notified as soon as you submit your issue.

**IMPORTANT:** Every issue you create will exist forever. We can only open/close issues, there is no delete button. They can be _edited_, but not completely removed.
